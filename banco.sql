Placing a grove costs  131.63 − 121 (based on level) health and  148.5 − 110.25 (based on level) mana, and cannot be cast if Ivern lacks the resources. The channel cannot be cancelled in the first 0.15 seconds and in the last 0.5 seconds.The grove matures over 40 − 1 (based on level) seconds. When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to free the monsters after 0.5 seconds, sending them away while receiving their  full gold and  full experience bounties.  Smiting a large monster within a grove will instantly free the camp\'s monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monsters\' current health. If the camp\'s large monster has already been slain, Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain. Starting at level 5, freeing the  Red Brambleback or the  Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp\'s buff, consuming it in the process. If at least one allied champion is nearby, Ivern can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only Ivern can consume.',' Active: Ivern throws a vine in the target direction, dealing  magic damage to the first enemy hit and  rooting them for a short duration.Ivern and his allies can target enemies  rooted by Rootcaller to  dash to them, placing themselves at  their attack range from the target.',' Passive: While in  brush, Ivern\'s basic attacks become  ranged  projectiles with  325 bonus range and deal bonus magic damage. These bonuses persist for 3 seconds after leaving brush.Ivern periodically stocks a Brushmaker charge, up to a maximum of 3. Active: Ivern grows a patch of brush at the target location for 30 seconds,  revealing the area within and around it for 3 seconds. Brushmaker spawns more brush if used near terrain or other brush.',' Active: Ivern gifts a Triggerseed to the target allied champion, himself or  Daisy,  shielding them for 2 seconds.At the end of its duration, Triggerseed bursts, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies and  slowing them for 2 seconds.',' Active: Ivern summons his sentinel friend  Daisy at his side, who remains on the field for 60 seconds as a controllable  minion. While  Daisy is active, Daisy! can be used to move her to the target location. If cast on Ivern himself, she will follow him.'),(429,' Martial Poise: Kalista\'s basic attacks have special interactions:\n Use only 90% attack damage.\n Miss if she loses  sight of her target before they hit.\n Cannot cancel their wind-up, but can select a new target within range.\n Make her  lunge in the target direction after issuing a movement command during a wind-up or right after casting  Pierce. The lunge distance scales with her boots tier.The wind-up while dashing is only reduced by 0.66% per  1% bonus attack speed compared to the standard 1% per 1%. Additionally, Kalista begins the game with  Black Spear, a unique item.',' Active: Kalista hurls a fast and narrow spear, dealing  physical damage to the first enemy hit.If Pierce kills its target, the spear continues onward, transferring all of the dead victim\'s  Rend stacks to the next enemy it hits. This can repeat indefinitely until the spear reaches its maximum distance.',' Passive - Soul-Marked: While Kalista and her  Oathsworn are linked, their basic attacks and  Pierce apply a Soul-Mark to their targets. If both Soul-Marks are applied within 2 seconds, the target takes  bonus magic damage (capped against non-champions), and cannot be Soul-Marked for 10 seconds. Soul-Mark deals 75 minimum damage to  minions and executes them if they\'re below  125 health. Passive: Kalista periodically stocks a Sentinel charge, up to a maximum of 2. Active: Kalista summons a Sentinel to  patrol along the target area.',' Passive: Kalista\'s basic attacks and  Pierce each lodge a spear in her target, stacking up to 255 times. The stack of spears remains for 4 seconds while untouched.Active: Kalista rips all lodged spears from nearby enemies, dealing physical damage and  slowing them for 2 seconds, with spears beyond the first dealing reduced damage. Rend deals 50% reduced damage to epic monsters. Rend resets its  cooldown and refunds  mana if it kills at least one target.',' Active: Kalista invokes her  link, retrieving her Oathsworn and carrying them in  stasis for 4 seconds.Kalista\'s Oathsworn can emerge to a target location, stopping at the first enemy hit,  knocking up all surrounding enemies and landing themselves at their basic attack range relative to the target hit.'),(432,' Ancient Chimes: Bard\'s presence causes sacred chimes to appear at random locations and linger for up to 10 minutes. Collecting a chime grants Bard  24% bonus movement speed out of combat for 7 seconds, stacking up to 5 times, with every other chime collected beyond the first granting an additional  14% bonus movement speed, up to a total of  80% bonus movement speed,  20 + (1 per minute after 5 minutes) experience, and  12% maximum mana. Bard empowers his  Meeps each time he collects 5 chimes. Meeps: Bard\'s presence attracts small spirits known as Meeps to his side. On-attack he consumes a Meep, dealing 40 (+ 15 per 5 chimes collected) (+ 30% AP)  bonus magic damage. At 5 chimes, Meeps start  slowing damaged enemies by 25% − 75% (based on number of Chimes) for 1 second, and at 15 chimes they deal splash damage to enemies within 150 units of his target as well as those in a cone behind them, with the cone\'s size increasing at 35 chimes. Meeps spawn every 8 − 4 (based on number of Chimes) seconds and Bard can keep up to 1 − 9 (based on number of Chimes) of them at a time.',' Active: Bard fires a burst of spirit energy in the target direction, dealing magic damage to the first enemy struck and briefly  slowing them by 60%.After Cosmic Binding hits an enemy, the burst of energy passes through them and searches for secondary targets. If it hits a wall or a second enemy, it  stuns both targets for the same duration, dealing the same magic damage to the second target as well.',' Active: Bard conjures a shrine at the target location that builds up in power over 10 seconds, up to 3 shrines active at once, which remain until consumed when a champion steps on them.If the champion was an ally or Bard himself, they are  healed for an amount based on the shrine\'s power and gain  50% bonus movement speed that decays over 1.5 seconds.',' Active: Bard opens a one-way magical corridor through a piece of terrain in the target direction for 10 seconds. Magical Journey will not cast unless it can open a corridor.Both allies and enemies can  pass through the corridor by right-clicking on it or its exit, with allies and Bard travelling at 33.3% increased speed.',' Active: Bard sends magical energy arcing to the target location, putting all units and structures in the target area into  stasis for 2.5 seconds upon impact.Despite normally being immune to crowd control, epic monsters and turrets (excluding the Nexus Obelisk) also enter  stasis.'),(497,' Basic Attacks: Rakan\'s basic attacks don\'t use  projectiles. Innate: Rakan periodically generates a 33 − 254 (based on level) (+ 90% AP)  shield that lasts until broken. If the shield is damaged, but not destroyed after being out of combat for 5 seconds, it will regenerate 10% of its maximum value every second. Damaging an enemy  champion with a basic attack or ability reduces the  cooldown of Fey Feathers by 1 second per champion hit. Lover\'s Leap: If either Rakan or  Xayah is  recalling, the other may move nearby and activate their own recall to join them. Both reach base at the time of which the initiator\'s recall ends.',' Active: Rakan slings an enchanted feather forward, dealing  magic damage to the first enemy hit.If that enemy was a champion or epic monster, an area is marked around Rakan. After 3 seconds or if an ally champion comes within the marked area, Rakan  heals himself and surrounding allies by 18 − 120 (based on level) (+ 70% AP).',' Active: Rakan  dashes to the target location.After a 0.35-second delay, he leaps into the air, dealing magic damage and  knocking up surrounding enemies for 1 second.',' Active: Rakan  leaps to an allied champion and  shields them for 3 seconds. Battle Dance can be re-cast for 5 seconds at no cost, and may select the same target again. If  Xayah is the target, Battle Dance is able to be cast from an increased range.',' Active: Rakan breaks into a captivating sprint for 4 seconds, gaining  50% bonus movement speed for the duration. During this time he deals magic damage to all enemy units he collides with,  charming and  slowing them by 75%. This may only occur once per unit.When Rakan collides with his first enemy champion he gains an additional  100% bonus movement speed, which starts decaying after 0.5 seconds by 20% every 0.5 seconds. During the first 0.5 seconds of The Quickness, Rakan is in cast time. During The Quickness, Rakan cannot basic attack enemy champions if he did not charm them.'),(498,' Innate: After casting an ability, Xayah\'s next 3 basic attacks penetrate through all enemies along a 900 range line, dealing 100% damage to her main target and 30 / 40 / 50% (based on level) pass-through damage to other enemies.
